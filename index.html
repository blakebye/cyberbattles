<p>The aim of the game is to destroy your opponents' commanders and keep yourself alive. You are given 18 different cards that have different resources to help you defeat your opponents before 35 rounds have passed. Each round you are able to play one of your cards, but you don't get to draw any new ones. Each card is one-use, with the exception of holo-detect.  We'll get to that below.</p>

<h1>
<a name="stages" class="anchor" href="#stages"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Stages</h1>

<p>As mentioned, the game takes place over 35 rounds. Each round has 2 stages for each player's turn: Action/targeting stage, and movement/attacking stage. The stages can go very quickly, so try to keep developing your strategy even when it's not your turn.</p>

<h2>
<a name="action-and-targeting" class="anchor" href="#action-and-targeting"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Action and Targeting</h2>

<p>The action phase gives you 20 seconds to choose the card you want to play. The targeting phase gives you 15 seconds to choose where you'd like to play your card.</p>

<h2>
<a name="creature-cards" class="anchor" href="#creature-cards"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Creature Cards</h2>

<p>Most of your cards should have creatures on them.  When you choose to play a creature card, you can take a gamble in "beaming down" the creature with the listed probability on the card, or you can bluff your opponent with a hologram. Holograms have a 100% success rate, and act exactly like the creature would, with the exception of not leaving a corpse upon death. This means that if you play the Mech Warrior, with a 10% chance of succeeding, and project a hologram, you will have a 9 strength and 9 attack creature on the board. However, holograms will be instantly killed by the holo-detect card, which has unlimited cast range.  Creatures are the only cards that can be played as a hologram.</p>

<h3>
<a name="creature-variety" class="anchor" href="#creature-variety"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Creature Variety</h3>

<p>Some creatures can fly over others like the knight of a chess board.  Some creatures can attack from range. Some creatures can act as a transport, or "mount" for your commander.  This will make him faster and also act as a meat shield protecting you from attacks. Slimy creatures can only be melee attacked by other slimy creatures.  Try to kill them with ranged attacks or spells!</p>

<h2>
<a name="alignment-cards" class="anchor" href="#alignment-cards"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Alignment Cards</h2>

<p>There are 4 cards that can change the alignment of the board. Life-force and Technology cards can change the alignment in their favor by 1 or 2 points. When the board is aligned in a certain direction, the probability of beaming down creatures that fall in that alignment is increased by 10% for each point in that direction. If 2 players both have Technology 1 and Technology 2, and all 4 cards succeed, the Mech Warrior will increase from a 10% chance to a 70% chance of beaming down without needing to project a hologram.</p>

<p>Tech alignment doesn't hurt lifeforce beam downs, and visa versa.  Alignment can ONLY HELP to get more creatures on the board.  Playing creatures of a certain alignment can also influence the alignment of the board, but not as fast as those 4 cards.</p>

<h2>
<a name="structures-cards" class="anchor" href="#structures-cards"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Structures Cards</h2>

<p>There are multiple cards that are considered structures. Fortress, Gun Turrets, Subspace Beacons, and Force Field are all "buildings" that are placed and unmovable. A fortress has 14 defense making it indestructible by anything, but it lasts for a random number of rounds. Gun Turrets have a different combat system from creatures, but any creature with 3 or lower attack can not kill a gun turret, and any creature with 8 or higher attack can not miss a gun turret. On the attacking end, I need to test defenses to see if similar values are ok. Subspace Beacons are like a Fortress but up to 8 can spawn and the enemy can use them. They are also destructible, but again act as a shield. Force Field puts up a permanent wall around you with small gaps to maneuver through.</p>

<h2>
<a name="commander-upgrade-cards" class="anchor" href="#commander-upgrade-cards"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Commander Upgrade Cards</h2>

<p>Cards like Blaster, Light-Sabre, Symbiont, Force Shield, and Force Armor all have a chance to make your commander's stats better. Jetpack will give him better speed and also allow him to fly.</p>

<h2>
<a name="spells" class="anchor" href="#spells"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Spells</h2>

<p>Virus can kill any alien with low enough resistance, EMP is the equivalent for robot. Both of these spells can be cast on a commander to have a chance to kill his whole alien/robot army.  Disrupt is a long range medium damage spell, and Disintegrate is a shorter range high damage spell. Hypnotize can steal an enemy creature, mutate can transform any creature, and resurrect can bring back corpses from the ground. Holograms do not leave corpses.  Teleport can move your commander very far.  All of these spells require your commander have line of sight to the target.</p>

<h2>
<a name="environmental-cards" class="anchor" href="#environmental-cards"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Environmental Cards</h2>

<p>Alien Goo and Fire are pretty unique.  They start on 1 square and randomly grow every round to try to cover the whole board. Your own Goo and Fire can't hurt you, but they can trap you on an edge or a corner and force a draw. Fire kills any enemy it grows into, while goo just covers the enemy stopping them from moving and can be attacked by both players to try to cut through it.</p>

<h3>
<a name="tips-and-tricks-for-actiontargeting" class="anchor" href="#tips-and-tricks-for-actiontargeting"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tips and Tricks for Action/Targeting</h3>

<p>All creatures can only be played in the 8 squares around you. It is generally wise to play your creatures at your diagonal because it's like moving a free square for slow piece.  </p>

<p>Holograms are a lot stronger if you have the last turn on the board because no one can use holo-detect on it for that round.</p>

<p>You can try to resurrect enemy or allied corpses in range; use this to steal your enemies dead Spiderite!</p>

<p>You can try to mutate enemy or allied creatures in range; use this to try and mutate your Alien Hatchling into a Spiderite!</p>

<h2>
<a name="movement-and-attacking" class="anchor" href="#movement-and-attacking"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Movement and Attacking</h2>

<p>Movement and Attacking give you a combined 40 seconds to move all your army.  This stage can take a lot of calculation. Should you go straight for the attack on your opponent's commander or would it be smarter to get into a corner where you can drop a force field and gather some time to bring out strong creatures? </p>

<h3>
<a name="tips-and-tricks" class="anchor" href="#tips-and-tricks"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Tips and Tricks</h3>

<p>Creatures' speed is what determines how far they can go in one turn.  Each non-diagonal move takes 1 speed, and each diagonal move takes 1.5 speed.  However, if you have 1 speed remaining you can travel diagonally and if you have .5 speed remaining you lose your move.  Again, try to end up moving diagonally to get a free square!</p>

<p>Units with a ranged attack are able to attack twice in one turn.  They must first engage someone in melee range, attack that target, and then are presented with the chance to fire their ranged weapon at any square in their line of sight.</p>

<h3>
<a name="combat" class="anchor" href="#combat"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Combat</h3>

<p>The way kills are calculated between creatures and commanders is pretty simple. If the attacker's strength is equal to the defender's defense, there is a 50% chance to kill. For every point extra in either direction, the chance moves by 10%.  So a 4 attack Slime Beast can NEVER kill a 9 defense Mech Warrior because 4 - 9 = -5.  With a base 50%, and subtracting 50%, there is a 0% chance to strike with a killing blow. However, don't relax too much because every time the 1 attack Probe attacks your 5 defense Commander he has a 10% chance to eliminate you from the game!</p>
