THIS REPOSITORY IS A WORK IN PROGRESS:
the readme is more like a brainstorming file until the project gets closer to 
completing

NEXT THINGS TO DO:  
    
    RESEARCH:       see if you can mutate an occupied mount... wtf??

                    figure out how alien goo/fire grow

                    double check that alien goo is tech 1 aligned???

    THINK IT OUT:   figure out how fortresses/gun turrets/subspace beacons work

    JUST DO IT:   * slime

                    mounts

                    kill_creature(commander)

if there's a gun turret creature, it must be included in the commanders list
of creatures so that it can attack. however, it can't be mutated, disrupted,
etc....

should fortress/beacon be mount with speed 0?

should gun turret be creature with speed 0? 

I THINK SO. KEEP THINKING

do structures have defense?

subspace beacon give 1 random card when you exit, after the 3rd turn

don't forget that every card played has a chance to influence alignment

implement slime into attacks

implement mounts housing commander as "tenant"

kill commander needs to clear the board
