WORK IN PROGRESS.

NEXT THING TO DO:   MAYBE A GUN TURRET CREATURE                
                    see if you can mutate an occupied mount... wtf??
                    figure out how alien goo/fire grow/smother

RANGED UNITS CAN ATTACK TWICE IN A ROUND VIA MELEE
ranged attacks need line of sight

should fortress/beacon be mount with speed 0?
should gun turret be creature with speed 0? I THINK SO. KEEP THINKING

i think just pair kill_structures etc with attack_structure

don't forget that every action can influence alignment

don't remove played card from hand until it is ACTUALLY played
